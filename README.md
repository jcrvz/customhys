**Customising optimisation metaheuristics via hyper-heuristic search** (CUSTOMHyS). This framework provides tools for solving, but not limited to, continuous optimisation problems using a hyper-heuristic approach for customising metaheuristics. Such an approach is powered by a strategy based on Simulated Annealing. Also, several search operators serve as building blocks for tailoring metaheuristics. They were extracted from ten well-known metaheuristics in the literature.

Detailed information about this framework can be found in [1, 2]. Plus, the code for each module is well-documented.

### üõ† Requirements:
Python 3.7 and higher. Packages: NumPy 1.18.5, SciPy 1.5.0, Matplotlib 3.2.2, json 2.0.9, tqdm 4.47.0.

## üß∞ Modules

The modules that comprise this framework depend on some basic Python packages, as well as they liaise each other. The module dependency diagram is presented as follows:

**NOTE:** Each module is briefly described below. If you require further information, please check the corresponding source code.

### ü§Ø Problems (benchmark functions)

This module includes several benchmark functions as classes to be solved by using optimisation techniques. The class structure is based on Keita Tomochika's repository [optimization-evaluation](https://github.com/keit0222/optimization-evaluation).

Source: [``benchmark_func.py``](customhys/benchmark_func.py)

### üëØ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Population

This module contains the class Population. A Population object corresponds to a set of agents or individuals within a problem domain. These agents themselves do not explore the function landscape, but they know when to update the position according to a selection procedure.

Source: [``population.py``](customhys/population.py)

### ü¶æ Search Operators (low-level heuristics)

This module has a collection of search operators (simple heuristics) extracted from several well-known metaheuristics in the literature. Such operators work over a population, i.e., modify the individuals' positions. 

Source: [``operators.py``](customhys/operators.py)

### ü§ñ Metaheuristic (mid-level heuristic)

This module contains the Metaheuristic class. A metaheuristic object implements a set of search operators to guide a population in a search procedure within an optimisation problem.

Source: [``metaheuristic.py``](customhys/metaheuristic.py)

### üëΩ Hyper-heuristic (high-level heuristic)

This module contains the Hyperheuristic class. Similar to the Metaheuristic class, but in this case, a collection of search operators is required. A hyper-heuristic object searches within the heuristic space to find the sequence that builds the best metaheuristic for a specific problem.

Source: [``hyperheuristic.py``](customhys/hyperheuristic.py)

### üè≠ Experiment

This module contains the Experiment class.  An experiment object can run several hyper-heuristic procedures for a list of optimisation problems.

Source: [``experiment.py``](customhys/experiment.py)

### üóúÔ∏è Tools

This module contains several functions and methods utilised by many modules in this package.

Source: [``tools.py``](customhys/tools.py)

### üíæ Data Structure

The experiments are saved in JSON files. The data structure of a saved file follows a particular scheme described below.
