# Data-driven Automatic Selector for Continuous Optimisation Problems (DASCOP)

This project aims to develop an approach based on, but not limited to, Data Science and Optimisation for solving continuous optimisation problems. As a final product, engineers and academicians can dispose of a framework for tailoring metaheuristics for these problems, closely related to practical engineering problems.

## Tasks

- [x] Collect metaheuristics and extract their search operators (SOs).
- [x] Collect benchmark functions (BFs) for continuous optimisation.
- [x] Build the optimisation framework.
- [x] Test this framework with the chosen SOs and BFs as a primary study.



- [ ] Test the search operators collection generating a 1-cardinality metaheuristic for each one


## Current data structure

- ```N``` is the number of files within data_files folder
- ```M``` is the number of hyper-heuristic iterations (metaheuristic candidates)
- ```C``` is the number of search operators in the metaheuristic (cardinality)
- ```P``` is the number of control parameters for each search operator
- ```R``` is the number of repetitions performed for each metaheuristic candidate
- ```D``` is the dimensionality of the problem tackled by the metaheuristic candidate
- ```I``` is the number of iterations performed by the metaheuristic candidate
 

- ```search_operator_structure``` corresponds to ```[operator_name = {str}, control_parameters = {dict: P}, selector = {str}]```
